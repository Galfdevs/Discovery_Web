# Discovery_Web
A 5-day training course offered by Campus 42 as an introduction to its teaching system, in this case focused on the web.  You won't learn how to program in 5 days, but you will learn how to work by prioritizing peer-to-peer and error reasoning.  It is also a first contact with the basics of web programming.
